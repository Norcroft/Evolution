# Evolution

This repository archives the historical development of the Norcroft toolchain.

It contains several independently sourced, partial snapshots of the codebase. Each set of files represents a different point in its life, and comparing them can reveal how the system evolved over time.

As further material becomes available, it will be inserted into the appropriate position in the Git history rather than added as new commits at the tip. As a result, commit hashes will change and existing checkouts may need to be reset or re-cloned.

The purpose of this archive is for reference and historical study. The collection does not compile in its current form, and no functional maintenance is planned.

Licensing varies across the files included here. Some files have no explicit open-source licence, but Codemist has uploaded them here for the purpose of historical interest. The ARM SDT 2.11a source is released under the Apache licence.
