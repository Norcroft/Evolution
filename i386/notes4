ELF Core Dumps

The exterior structure of an ELF core dump is very simple: an
ordinary ELF container, with no section header table but a program
header table. Most of the stuff in the PHT is simply areas of
memory, making things very simple indeed.

The tricky thing is the NOTE section in the PHT. This contains four
notes, in the `namesz/descsz/type/name/desc' structure given in the
ELF specs (page 2-5). The notes are:

Name "CORE", type 1: process status.

Name "CORE", type 2: process FPU state.

Name "CORE", type 3: process information.

Name "CORE", type 4: task structure.
