BUGS
----

PUSHR->PUSHM amalgamation doesn't work when the registers are in the
wrong order. I have a fix.

CSE appears not to notice that PUSHR has a side effect. I have a
fix.

LSB info gets trashed in register allocator, causing a used register
to be assumed unused. I have a workaround but can't remember where I
left the exhibit.
